/**
 * A course. 
 *
 * Keep in mind that this is a simplification. In real life, a course can span many years
 * so we would likely need intermediary objects for course_session.
 *
 * This class demonstrates simple properties (courseName, courseCode, description). It also
 * shows how the database mapping can be influenced with the mapping metadata appearing at the 
 * bottom of the file. In this instance, we slightly change the column names used in the database
 * and change the type of the description property from the conventional varchar to a text lob field.
 * Finally, this class also shows the use of constraints metadata to tell the framework about
 * a validation criteria : that courseCode should not be longer than 20 characters.
